===================

Automated archiving of publically available source code repositories of Quake related things.

Dependencies:
Bash (4?)
git (if you are on Debian then also git-svn)

Todo:
Make adding new items possible without having to edit the script.


Please send me more repository URLs.

The archive is not public at the moment, just ask if you need something from it.
